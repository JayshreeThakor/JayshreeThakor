# Hi, I'm Jayshree Thakor

**Android Engineer** focused on system reliability, security, and migration strategies.

I am an Android engineer with 3+ years of production experience. I specialize in the "invisible" challenges of mobile development—keeping background services alive during Doze mode, ensuring real-time location accuracy, and securing sensitive PII data in parental control applications.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

| Domain | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Languages** | Kotlin, Java |
| **UI Frameworks** | Jetpack Compose, XML (View System), Custom Canvas |
| **Architecture** | MVVM, Clean Architecture |
| **Concurrency** | Coroutines, Flow, WorkManager, Services |
| **Data & Network** | Room (with AES-256), Retrofit, OkHttp, Firebase (FCM, Auth) |
| **System APIs** | Accessibility Services, Location APIs, UsageStatsManager |

### 🔭 What I Build

My work primarily revolves around **Parental Control** and **Child Safety** domains. I don't just build UI; I engineer systems that interact deeply with the Android OS.

**Production Highlights:**
* **Background Reliability:** Engineered tracking systems using `WorkManager` and `Coroutines` that maintain reliable execution despite Android's aggressive battery optimizations (Doze mode).
* **System Constraints:** leveraged Android **Accessibility Services** to build robust "App Blocking" and screen time restriction features across different manufacturer OS versions.
* **Security:** Implemented **AES-256 encryption** for local Room databases to ensure strict privacy compliance for sensitive child data.
* **Modernization:** Led the migration of legacy XML codebases to **Jetpack Compose**, reducing boilerplate code by ~40% and improving rendering performance.

### 💼 Real-World Projects

**Kids Nanny & SafeMinor**
* *Role:* Core Developer
* *Focus:* Real-time device monitoring, Geo-fencing triggers, and background service optimization. Managed Google Play Store compliance regarding sensitive permissions.

**Poster Festival Post Maker**
* *Role:* Developer
* *Focus:* Built a custom canvas engine allowing users to manipulate dynamic text layers and graphics programmatically.

### ⚡ Engineering Philosophy

* **Production > Tutorials:** I prioritize code that handles edge cases (like network loss or device restart) over "happy path" implementation.
* **User Privacy:** Handling PII requires more than just functional code; it requires architectural security.
* **Maintainability:** I believe in leaving the codebase cleaner than I found it, enforcing strict MVVM patterns to prevent technical debt.
